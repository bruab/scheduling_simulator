Question 1) See ex1/mat_mul_init.c.

Question 2) See ex1/matmul_outerproduct.c.

Question 3) See ex1/results/parallel_speedup.png. The parallel speedup for the optimal platform with 1600 processors is an amazing 1033.5! However, for the normal platform it's a modest 11.125, actually worse than using 16 or 64 processors. On a real machine I would rein in the number of processors used, regardless of how many are available. 

Question 4) Ran out of time; moved on to project.
